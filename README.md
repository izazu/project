This code is a JavaScript script that creates a vertical slider using the DOM API. The script starts by defining several constant variables that reference different elements in the HTML document: sliderContainer, slideRight, slideLeft, upButton, downButton, and slidesLength. The slidesLength variable is used to store the number of slides in the slider.

The script then defines a variable activeSlideIndex that is initially set to 0, which is used to keep track of the currently active slide. The slideLeft element's top position is set to a negative value that corresponds to the total number of slides in the slider.

The script then adds click event listeners to the upButton and downButton elements, which call the changeSlide function and pass in either the string "up" or "down" as an argument.

The changeSlide function takes in a direction argument, which is either "up" or "down". It then uses this argument to determine whether to increment or decrement the activeSlideIndex variable. If the active slide index exceeds the number of slides or goes below 0, it will reset to 0 or the total number of slides respectively.

The function then updates the transform property of the slideRight and slideLeft elements to move the active slide up or down by multiplying the activeSlideIndex variable with the sliderHeight variable.

The function also calls the getMessage function, which uses the fetch API to get a message from a local json server. It creates a new element to append message to, and appends the message element to the DOM
